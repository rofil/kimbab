It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning.</td><td>1</td><td>1-10</td><td>12343434X</td><td>Wed, 26 Jun 2019 18:23:06 +0000</td><td>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 05:26:24 +0000</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Yes</td><td>Journal Social Science</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>http://google.com</td><td>ed14f4b59e6d8e3e9c5873f7b5a28273.docx</td><td>1</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>1-10</td><td>123</td><td>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 16:41:15 +0000</td><td>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 16:41:15 +0000</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>EFIKASI VAKSIN Pseumulvacc® PADA BUDIDAYA IKAN NILA (Oreochromis niloticus) DI KABUPATEN KUTAI KARTANEGARA</td><td>Journal Ilmu Perikanan Tropis</td><td>22</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>d37371c4bd6e95998dfd7d0b57603b0b.pdf</td><td>1</td><td>The aim of this study was to evaluate the eficacy of Pseumulvacc® vaccine and effect of vaccine to tilapia growth and survival rate (SR) on tilapia aquaculture in Kutai Kartanegara, East Kalimantan. This vaccine has made from Pseudomonas sp. (EP-01) inactivated used formalin 3%. Bacteria of Pseudomonas sp. isolated from sick and die tilapia in Loa Kulu, Kutai Kartanegara. The fish used in this study was tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) weight ±11 g and length ±7,5 cm, the research done in 3 method, immersion, feed and control. The density of bacteria vaccine in 3 method ware 108 CFU/mL
for immersion, 104 CFU/mL for feed and no added vaccine in control method. Immersion method procedure begins dips tilapia with vaccine for 30 minutes (5-10 of fish/L). While vaccine by feed method begins by mixing the vaccine with feed (1 mL / g feed). Mixing feed gave to tilapia for 14 days with 2 times daily, then the fish reared for 30 days. The observed parameters ware survival rate (SR), relative percent survival (RPS), and growth (weight and length of fish). The result of this study shown that Pseumulvacc® survival rate (SR) in immersion method was 52,8% and by feed method was 29,5%. Relative percent survival (RPS) of each research ware 40,9% by immersion and 11,7% by feed. The best growth in this research is feed method rate by 28,33 g/month than immersion method 16,33 g/month.</td><td>2</td><td>30-35</td><td>1412-2006</td><td>Fri, 05 Jul 2019 17:04:13 +0000</td><td>Sat, 13 Jul 2019 08:33:44 +0000</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>DSDS</td><td>SADFASDF</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>SDAFASD</td><td>b71110e2f8e1ddfa79847ff54e3446bb.docx</td><td>1</td><td>FSDAFAS</td><td>1</td><td>ASDFASDF</td><td>SDFSADF</td><td>Sat, 06 Jul 2019 01:00:21 +0000</td><td>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 05:26:24 +0000</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>tesing</td><td>Jourmal Inter</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>8de3c795b3ac44cb3f0812c1e8adfa50.xcf</td><td>1</td><td>sdf</td><td>1</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 15:48:30 +0000</td><td>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 05:26:24 +0000</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>SDFDSF</td><td>SDFSD</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>SDF</td><td>322688dfffed0b029fdded3376eac8d4.pdf</td><td>1</td><td>SAFDFSD</td><td>1</td><td>11</td><td>SDFDS</td><td>Wed, 10 Jul 2019 15:49:28 +0000</td><td>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 05:26:24 +0000</td></tr></table></body></html>
